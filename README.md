## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   When I finished the project and start reading the submission instructions I found out that I need to submit a gif that represents key features of the 
   program. I have never created a gif before and didn't know how it should look like. So I googled it and found a useful
   article that showed me step by step what I need to do in order to finish this step. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I really liked the project and the guided walkthrough for completing it. It's fascinating how different programming languages are integrated and add all that functionality to the website.
   Now I wonder how programmers organize the code in a large website?
   How do they program it, so it's easier to maintain, to find bugs, and easier to update it?
   I understand that these questions are very broad but every time I work on a small project like this, I think about the real-world websites and their implementation.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  1) add images and different sounds for each button
  2) add a ticking clock
  3) let the user choose the difficulty of the game, for example choose how many buttons to include
  4) create a scoreboard so the user can see the score for the last 3 games played.
